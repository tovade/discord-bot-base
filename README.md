# Discord bot template
 ## about
Discord.js v14 template with (almost) everything you need to start a bot

## Configuration
 ### Environment
the .env only stores the token for security reasons as it is not a safe practice to have your token in a .json file

### Settings.json
The settings.json contains small config that isn't extremely insecure.
The reload boolean in the interaction object is for deleting all interactions and recreating them via the discord api.
